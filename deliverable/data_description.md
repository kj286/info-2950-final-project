# INFO 2950 Final Project
## Deliverable - Data Description

The observation is the current status of internship, whether it's ongoing, paused, or canceled in the event of coronavirus. The attributes are industry of the internship, company, internship position, location and compensation.

This dataset was created because in the face of this pandemic, the global economy and the job market have suffered huge losses. Our team wants to examine factors that attribute to the current status of internship. We wonder if these factors have any correlation with the company's decision in dealing with its internship programs.

We sent the survey to a lot of people we know, which could results in bias in our data because it's not a random sample. People who filled out this survey are mostly college students who are currently looking for jobs, and the majority of them are business and engineering majors. The data that we collected are not large enough to represent phenomenon across different industries, thus it's very limited. 

We've pre-processed the data by allowing mostly multiple-choice questions on our survey to limit the variability in responses. We've also gone through all the entries and standardized any abbreviations on the short answer questions we did have (enter company and job function), so that our data analysis would not require extra steps later on.

Everyone we surveyed was aware that their data was being collected, and they were told about our intentions with the study. As all survey participants are current university students interested in the internship search, they were supportive of our analysis and also wanted to know the answers to our analysis goals.
