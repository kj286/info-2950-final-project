# INFO 2950 Final Project
## Deliverable - Data Description

The observation is the current status of internship, whether it's ongoing, paused, or canceled in the event of coronavirus. The attributes are industry of the internship, company, company size, internship position, location and compensation.

This dataset was created because in the face of this pandemic, the global economy and the job market have suffered huge losses. Our team wants to examine factors that attribute to the current status of internship. We wonder if these factors have any correlation with the company's decision in dealing with its internship programs.

Mentioned in the potential problem section of the deliverable, we distributed the survey on our social media, which could have potentially resulted in voluntary response bias. However, we ensured to minimize the effect of such bias by randomly picking thirty people in each of our contact list and asking them to fill out the survey. Furthermore, we also referred to online websites, constructed by other students, on internship status to cross check the validity of our responses. At the beginning stage, we did not receive a lot of responses and thus were unable to make generalizations from the survey responses. Nonethless, as time went on, we each randomly picked more people to fill out the survey and eventually gathered over 150 responses, from a wide range of diverse industries and companies.

We've pre-processed the data by allowing mostly multiple-choice questions on our survey to limit the variability in responses. We've also gone through all the entries and standardized abbreviations or repetition on the short answer questions we did have (enter company and job function), so that our data analysis would not require extra steps later on. We also cleaned up our dataset to eliminate entries of those who answered "no" to our first question, "Were you going to have an internship this summer" and eventually built an organized dataset for data analysis.

Everyone we surveyed was aware that their data was being collected, and they were told about our intentions with the study. As all survey participants are current university students interested in the internship search, they were supportive of our analysis and also wanted to know the answers to our analysis goals.
