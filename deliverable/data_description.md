# INFO 2950 Final Project
## Deliverable - Data Description

The observation is the current status of internship, whether it's ongoing, paused, or canceled in the event of coronavirus. The attributes are industry of the internship, company, internship position, location and compensation.

This dataset was created because in the face of this pandemic, global economy and the job market have suffered huge losses. My team and I want to examine factors that attribute to the current status of internship. We wonder if these factors have any correlation with the company's decision in dealing with its internship programs.

We sent the survey to a lot of people we know, which could results in bias in our data because it's not a random sample. People who filled out this survey are mostly college students who are currently looking for jobs, and the majority of them are business and engineering majors. The data that we collected are not large enough to represent phenomenon across different industries, thus it's very limited.
