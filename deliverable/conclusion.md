## Deliverable - Conclusion

STELLA: What did you find over the course of your data analysis?

KEVIN: How confident are you in these conclusions?
In general, we are confident with our data set and conclusions but also acknolwedge limitations on our data and subsequent regression and hypothesis tests analysis. While we tried our best to gather as much data as possible and eventually ended up with internship data on a little over 100 internships companies across 10 industries with a variety of positions, some categories lacked enough data entries to reach a 100% accurate conclusion.

Nonetheless, with our regression model, which presented an r-squared value of 64%, and individual hypothesis tests run on 99% confidence level, we believe our findings contain meaningful insight into what affects current internship status.

BEBA: Interpret these results in the wider context of the real-life application from where your data hails.
