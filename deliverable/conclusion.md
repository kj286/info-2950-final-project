## Deliverable - Conclusion

STELLA: What did you find over the course of your data analysis?

KEVIN: How confident are you in these conclusions?
In general, we are confident with our data set and conclusions but also acknolwedge limitations on our data and subsequent regression and hypothesis tests analysis. While we tried our best to gather as much data as possible and eventually ended up with internship data on a little over 100 internships companies across 10 industries with a variety of positions, some categories lacked enough data entries to reach a 100% accurate conclusion.

Nonetheless, with our regression model, which presented an r-squared value of 64%, and individual hypothesis tests run on 99% confidence level, we believe our findings contain meaningful insight into what affects current internship status.

We hope that our analysis can shed light towards which industries will survive post Covid-19 and which industries may suffer, so that we can help fellow undergraduate students better understand which career paths or industries may be the most sustainable and secure for their futures. We believe it's incredibly important for students to develop professionally in their undergraduate years, so our analysis regarding Covid-19 impacts on the job market will be particularly useful to those graduating in 2020 and 2021. On a greater scale, however, we hope that our analysis can highlight industries that are well equipped to survive any unexpected halt in the economy, should one come in the future, so that students can be prepared for any circumstance when they graduate and begin their lifelong careers.
