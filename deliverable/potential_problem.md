# INFO 2950 Final Project
## Deliverable - Potential Problems with Dataset

1. During the process of gathering data, we simply distributed the survey on our social media and sent them to our friends to reach a maximum amount of results, which means most of the responses are from people that we know rather than completely randomized inputs.

2. All of our attributes are categorical data and so we need to transform them to numeric data before processing them and running regression models to study their influence on summer internship status.

3. Some of the answers for the survey are entered in short answer forms and so have overlaps with one another even if they represent the same thing, which requires further cleaning and organization.

4. Though we have gathered 50+ responses for the survey so far, some of them were not going to have internships and thus did not contribute to the dataset. Our group needs to collect more responses from companies of a wider variety.
