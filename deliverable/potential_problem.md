# INFO 2950 Final Project
## Deliverable - Potential Problems with Dataset

1. During the process of gathering data, we simply distributed the survey on our social media and sent them to our friends to reach a maximum amount of results, which means most of the responses are from people that we know rather than completely randomized inputs.

2. All of our attributes are categorical data and so we transformed them to numeric data before processing them for regression and hypothesis tests to study their influence on summer internship status.

3. A lot of the answers for the survey are entered in short answer forms and so have overlaps with one another , which required further cleaning and organization.

4. For the "Paid" attribute in the dataset, we thought it would invade individual privacy and industry working guideline by asking the participants to reveal their salary and so only asked if they were going to be paid or not even though having actual numbers for pay would help us reach a more accurate correlation evaluation.
