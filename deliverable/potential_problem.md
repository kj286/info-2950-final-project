# INFO 2950 Final Project
## Deliverable - Potential Problems with Dataset

1. We distributed the survey on our social media, which could have potentially resulted in voluntary response bias because people who have had their internships cancelled would be less likely to fill out the survey. However, we ensured to minimize the effect of such bias by randomly picking thirty people in each of our contact list and asking them to fill out the survey. Furthermore, we also referred to online websites, constructed by other students, on internship status to cross check the validity of our responses.

2. A lot of the answers for the survey are entered in short answer forms and so contain abbreviations or repetitions with one another, which required further cleaning and organization.

3. Most of our attributes are categorical data and so we had to transform them to numeric data before processing them for regression  to study their influence on summer internship status.

4. For the "Paid" attribute in the dataset, we thought it would invade individual privacy and industry working guideline by asking the participants to reveal their salary and so only asked if they were going to be paid or not even though having actual numbers for pay would help us reach a more accurate correlation evaluation.
