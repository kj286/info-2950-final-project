## Idea No. 1
   Data on global patterns of alcohol consumption, patterns of drinking, beverage types, the prevalence of alcoholism; and consequences, including crime, mortality and road incidents. Some examples would be alcohol expenditure as a share of total household expenditure, average per capita alcohol consumption in 15-19 years old, and etc.

## Idea N0. 2
  The second idea we have for dataset is on the gender and ethnicity distribution of the United States Labor Force of 2019. The research question at hand will revolve around the different gender and ethnicity ratios within each industry. With unprecedented social development and technological advancement, more and more discussions on equal opportunities for social minority groups have taken place in physical settings  through online platforms. It has been a primary focus to promote diversity within work space and voice concern over industries and companies that have outrageous disparity in its gender and racial distribution.

  Detailed numbers of labor force within a variety of industries from Agriculture to Financial activities, to education and health services, and etc. are made available on the website of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, which grants authority and accuracy. Statistics on "Employed persons by detailed industry, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity" in monthly, annual tables are all available to the public, accompanied by charts and articles evaluating the data.
