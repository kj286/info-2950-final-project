## Idea No. 1
   Data on global patterns of alcohol consumption, patterns of drinking, beverage types, the prevalence of alcoholism; and consequences, including crime, mortality and road incidents. Some examples would be alcohol expenditure as a share of total household expenditure, average per capita alcohol consumption in 15-19 years old, and etc.

## Idea N0. 2
  The second idea we have for dataset is on the gender and ethnicity distribution of the United States Labor Force of 2019. The research question at hand will revolve around the different gender and ethnicity ratios within each industry. With unprecedented social development and technological advancement, more and more discussions on equal opportunities for social minority groups have taken place in physical settings  through online platforms. It has been a primary focus to promote diversity within work space and voice concern over industries and companies that have outrageous disparity in its gender and racial distribution.

  Detailed numbers of labor force within a variety of industries from Agriculture to Financial activities, to education and health services, and etc. are made available on the website of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, which grants authority and accuracy. Statistics on "Employed persons by detailed industry, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity" in monthly, annual tables are all available to the public, accompanied by charts and articles evaluating the data.

## Idea NO. 3
  Our third idea for a dataset is on global extreme poverty, using data first published in 2013 and revised in 2019. The research can include studies such as how geography or demography may affect poverty levels around the world, how price levels in different countries affect measure of poverty, cross-country puchasing power, and analyzing the poorest countries of the world.

  At a high level, this study will help us better understand the global economy and how larger and smaller powers come together to trade. It will also highlight how and why the inequal distribution of wealth occurs. More specifically, the study can help us understand how to mitigate the effects of global poverty, as the poorest people in the world are often left hungry, uneducated, and in poor health.

## Idea NO.4
  Our last idea for a dataset is on the status of summer internships this year. Undoubtedly the outbreak of coronavirus has affected every single one of us. For college students, many have had their internships cancelled, transitioned to remote, or paused. Thus, we want to study if companies decisions regarding their summer internship programs have anything to do with their industry, size, location, and etc.

  There is no official report on the status of the current job market on the internet and so we will need to use surveys to gather data on different companies. From the survey, we will clean and organize the data to produce a final prediction and analysis.
