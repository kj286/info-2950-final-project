## For teams:

We agree to the following policies for our team. Once agreed to, these policies cannot be changed for the duration of the project.

#### Team roles. Any specific roles within the group, their responsibilities, and how those roles will be assigned or rotated.
- On top of coding and writing, the following will be the workflow and responsibilities for each individual:
- Kevin: Organize and divide the work and host the weekly meetings, submit the final version
- Stella and Rebecca: proof read code and writings


#### Decision making. For example: consensus, majority vote, or team captain.
- All decisions should reach  a consensus among the team members, and so if there is disagreeable parts, we need to voice it either in the group message or at the meeting to resolve it.
- If the team fails to reach a consensus, members will vote on the matter and go with the option with the majority vote.



#### Communication. Methods of communication, expectations for response times.
- Zoom and message will be our main methods of communication
- Message the group when we complete our part and then notify the next person in charge
- Maintain an 8 hour response time between 9:00 am to 12:00 pm.



#### Meeting times. When and where you will meet, expectations for attendance.
- We will meet twice a week on Wednesday and Sunday, each for an hour.
- Under the current circumstances, all meetings will take place online via zoom unless absolutely necessary to meet in person.
- Attendance is mandatory for these bi-weekly meetings; if there is a reason one of us cannot make it to the meeting, he/she needs to inform the group at least an hour before the meeting, send his/her feedback or updates in written form to the group chat, and catch up on the meeting material later.



#### Balance of responsibilities. Procedures for ensuring that everyone contributes.
- At the beginning of weekly meetings, we need to give an update on what we have accomplished after the last meeting.
- At the end of weekly meetings, we need to formulate a todo list for each member for the next meeting.
- If one of us fail to meet the expectation, he/she needs to offer a valid excuse and make up for the work immediately.
- If one of us continuously fail to meet the progress and expectation of the team more than two times, a warning will be given, and if he/she still fail to contribute to the project after the warning, a note will be recorded and sent to the faculty and TAs.



#### Conflict Resolution. What we will do when we identify problems, and how we will resolve them.
- We will resolve all conflicts with respect and in good faith.
- Contract can be edited at anytime as long as all parties agree.
- If there is a personal conflict, we should privately message/call the teammate first; If the conflict is applicable to all members, we should message the group and discuss possible solutions as a group and vote on the ultimate solution.



#### Availability. When each member will not be available for any reason, and how you will work around these absences.
- We will all try to be available from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm everyday and if one of us is not available at the moment, he/she needs to response within at most 8 hours.
- If one of us is not available for the weekly meetings, he or she needs to inform the group with a valid excuse at least an hour before the meeting, send his/her updates in the group prior to the meeting and catch up with the rest of the team after the meeting.
