# INFO 2950 Team Todos
Names/netids: Kevin Jiang/kj286, Stella Shi/zs278, Rebecca Fu/rf382

# PHASE 0: Coordination and planning. Due April 10.
- COMPLETED: Whether or not youâ€™re working in a group, fill out the work contract template included in the CMS assignment. If you're working alone, make a contract with yourself to set clear time commitments. Managing your time and making regular, consistent progress is the biggest factor that - makes projects successful.
- COMPLETED: Submit a .txt file on CMS stating your method of communication (if applicable) and with your completed work contract.

# PHASE I: Brainstorming. Due April 17.
- COMPLETED: Set up a Github repository for your project files (or using the file-sharing service of your choice).
Meet (virtually) with your group if you are collaborating (see Zoom guide). Write down at least three ideas for datasets. Include as much information as possible about the availability of data.
- COMPLETED: Submit a .txt file on CMS that contains a link to your Github repository and your dataset ideas.

# PHASE II: Initial data collection. Due May 5 (updated 04/27).
- COMPLETED - TOGETHER: Settle on a single idea.
- TOGETHER: Carry out most of your data collection.
- COMPLETED - KEVIN: Submit an executed Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file on CMS where you identify any potential problems with your dataset.
- COMPLETED - KEVIN: Have an initial draft of introduction:
  - What is the context of the work? What research question are you trying to answer? What are your main findings?
- COMPLETED - BEBA & STELLA: Have an initial draft of your data description section:
  - COMPLETED - STELLA: What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?
  - COMPLETED - STELLA: Why was this dataset created?
  - COMPLETED - STELLA: What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?
  - COMPLETED - BEBA: What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?
  - COMPLETED - BEBA: If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?
  - COMPLETED - BEBA: Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).

# PHASE III: Final Results. Due May 15th.
- KEVIN: A dataset of moderate size and complexity: gather, organize, clean, and curate raw dataset
- COMPLETED: Introduction
- COMPLETED: Data Description
- STELLA & BEBA: Data Analysis:
  - STELLA: Use summary functions like mean and standard deviation along with visual displays like scatter plots and histograms to describe data.
  - BEBA: Provide at least one model showing patterns or relationships between variables that addresses your research question. This could be a regression or clustering, or something else that measures some property of the dataset.
- TOGETHER: Evaluation of significance:
  - Use hypothesis tests, simulation, randomization, or any other techniques we have learned to compare the patterns you observe in the dataset to simple randomness.
- KEVIN: Conclusion:
  - What did you find over the course of your data analysis?
  - How confident are you in these conclusions?
  - Interpret these results in the wider context of the real-life application from where your data hails.
- TOGETHER: Source Code: Provide a link to your Github repository (or other file hosting site) that has all of your project code (if applicable).
- TOGETHER: Acknowledgments
- TOGETHER: Submit an executed Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file on CMS, with all of the required elements, as detailed in the deliverables section above.
